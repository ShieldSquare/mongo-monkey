mongo-monkey
============

Mongo-monkey is a wrapper on mongodb's java driver. The idea is to make this mongo java driver immediately usable for any person who has knowledge of the mongo cli. Ideally, it should involve an almost zero learning curve and at the same time, not cut down on the felxibility provided to the deveoper.
