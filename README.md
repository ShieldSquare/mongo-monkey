mongo-monkey
============

Mongo-monkey is a wrapper on mongodb's java driver. The idea is to make the mongo java driver immediately usable for any person who has knowledge of the mongo cli. Ideally, it should involve a close to zero learning curve and at the same time, not compromise on the flexibility provided to the developer. 

Disclaimer
----------
This wrapper is licensed under GPL license. It was heavily customized for local usage at [ShieldSquare](http://github.com/ShieldSquare) and may not provide all functionalities which are originally provided by the mongo java driver. This project was solely aimed at reducing the learning curve and the code redundancy of the underlying java driver. It can be used to quickly hack up mongo clients.

Current Status
--------------
Unstable dev version of ~~0.4 is being built right now~~ ~~Soon, we will release a stable version 1.0 with documentation.~~  I no longer maintain this repository or work for ShieldSquare :)
